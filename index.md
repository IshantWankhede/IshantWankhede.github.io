## Experience

### Sr. Software Engineer Data Science, Research Associate  
Abzooba Inc., Pune  
Aug 2015 – Present
- Working on Machine Learning problems in healthcare, retail, and insurance sectors. Responsible for end-to-end implementation involving feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and productionization of learning systems, along with infrastructure setup and data visualization across projects:
  - Coreference based Pronoun resolution using neuralcoref (SpaCy)
  - Simple Question Answering using pre-trained Bi-Directional Attention Flow for Machine Comprehension with ELMO embedding
  - Classifier to identify third party subrogation potential (XGBoost, word2vec, coreNLP, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
  - Predict product sales from online reviews (OLS regression, regARIMA, word2vec, coreNLP)
  - Fraud detection model for healthcare claims (Multivariate Gaussian Anomaly detection)
  - Classifier to identify future complaints from conversations (Tf-idf, Affinity Propagation)
  - Diabetes prediction model (L1 regularized Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, ensemble)

### Student Trainee  
Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore  
May 2014 – July 2014
- Worked on enhancing USB-OTG functionalities over Media Transfer Protocol.
- Developed two-way master-slave data transfer over OTG for a Phone migration application.

### Summer Intern  
Reliance Industries Ltd, Navi Mumbai  
May 2013 – June 2013
- Focused on cost optimisation, logistics, and SCM of RIL and export procedures in SEZs; analysed logistics cost for opportunities in cost saving.
- Developed a tool for dynamic suggestion of least cost option for a shipping destination.

## Projects Undertaken

### Finite Difference Methods for Option Pricing
*Guide: Prof. Dr. S. Natesan, Dept. Of Mathematics, IIT Guwahati*
- Developed numerical methods for solving the Black-Scholes equation for European and Asian options using finite difference methods for spatial derivatives and the Crank-Nicolson scheme for time derivatives.
- Studied errors in numerical methods for diminishing volatility in options; used non-uniform mesh for spatial discretization to minimize error and compared results with uniform mesh.

### Identify Third Party Subrogation Potential from Unstructured Insurance Adjusters’ Notes
- Built a Document2Vector model (expanding Word2Vector) and defined features for insurance use cases.
- Enhanced typed dependencies from dependency trees, built generalized phrase constructs to capture cause-and-damage from text.
- Developed a heuristic rule engine and XGBoost classifier, ensembled with Logistic Regression; worked on transfer learning and dynamic AIC feature selection.
- Built a framework for distributing the application across multiple servers.

### Predicting Product Sales Explained by Online Reviews and Social Media Content
- Built a knowledge-hierarchy from word2vec entities to map online reviews to product attributes.
- Quantified text reviews by sentiment analysis, showing correlation to sales; modeled and predicted future sales using regARIMA.

### Multi-variate Gaussian Fraud Detection Model for Insurance Claims
- Built an anomaly detection model from scratch in SAS to identify fraud, waste, and abuse in medical claims.
- Designed hypotheses for features such as up-coding and overbilling after a research phase.

### Diabetes Prediction Model
- Developed a statistical model to predict the probability of being diabetic in the next two years; ensured deployment, testing, and error logging.
- Built a visualization tool on top of model results to generate actionable insights.

### Sampling of Posterior of Weibull Distribution Parameters
*Guide: Dr. Arabin Kumar Dey, Dept. Of Mathematics, IIT Guwahati*
- Generated samples from the posterior of modified Weibull distribution using Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm in R and MATLAB.
